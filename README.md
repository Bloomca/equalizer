# Equalizer in js

It is proof of concept application written in [cycle.js](http://cycle.js.org/), basically I was interested in playing with Web Audio API and getting to know streams better. I am not an expert in cycle.js, I just wanted to explore this interesting framework and to build something working and not so artificially sandbox. I used latest (at the moment) version of cycle.js with [xstreams](https://github.com/staltz/xstream) under the hood.

So this project is web audio player with equalizer (which uses [BiquadFilter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/BiquadFilterNode)), which is built with [lowshelf/highshelf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BiquadFilterNode/type) filters at the ends and with [peaking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BiquadFilterNode/type) filters in between. You can watch spectrogram during the play; it is better to use latest Chrome, but in Firefox and Safari it should work too. Also I have to admit that due to low quality (I think it is 128 kbits per second) edge filters are not very important, but filters around 4â€“6 kHz are pretty noticeable, both in sound and spectrogram.

I get tracks from SoundCloud, which are searched by query and filtered by [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode) license, and then I just stream them through [WebAudioApi](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement).
Currently player supports playlists, which means that it remember list from which you took your playing track and will continue to play next one.

# TODO

- add tests (it was created like proof of concept without deep knowing of )
- add responsive support
- refactor to [MVI](http://cycle.js.org/model-view-intent.html) concept
- performance issues; think about playDriver
- add filters to search
- add router and ability to explore content more broadly
